Model description       : Doh! A carrot of course :)


Other info              : 

So, I finally finished it after almost a year.
Long story.  Hope ya like it.  There will be sounds 
and vwep coming soon but the actuall model here is
complete, finished, that's it!

The model was originally the weapon for the pogo rabbit.
It was a teensy little thing.  I never had any cash for
something like 3D Studio Max and Q2Modeller can't really do
joints.  So when I found the carrot I thought 'Well now then,
theres a player plug-in waiting to happen'

So, I scaled the model up to player size; scrapped the anims;
gave him eyes; made new animations (I reckon they're pretty cool :]); 
made some wicked ctf skins; and finally, Flatus (Who Clucked?) did some
hilarious sounds.  Sorted.

I also fixed the vwep bug.  If you downloaded this before the 10th of March 2000
then you'll need to replace it!  But then again, if you're reading this you already
have :)


Have fun.

Additional Credits to   : [Wc?]Flatus for the sounds.

Thanks to               : [LP]Rattey for spotting the bug fix :) Cheers geezer.
